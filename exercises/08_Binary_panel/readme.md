In order to implement the Monte Carlo study of Binary Response panel data models in ps8, I recommend you to have a look at the notebook for Monte Carlo study in ps7 ( https://github.com/bschjerning/EconometricsB/blob/main/exercises/07_Binary/ex_post/monte_carlo.ipynb ).

Note also that the code for ps8 differs a bit from the exercises in the rest of the course and is based on Bertel's slides. A equally rewarding exercise could be to code up the binary response panel data models so that it fits into the framework of the M-estimation that we use for the rest of the exercises.
